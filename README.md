# AndroidMalwareScanner
Set up an API that can scan Android apps (APKs) and classify them as Malicious (potential malware) or Benign.
I also utilized APIs from other providers, such as VirusTotal and similar services, to scan and classify the files.


To run it on docker use this command:
```docker-compose up --build```
